Typescript Generics

Dr. Stites

• I am behind with work what shall I prioritise on first? 
Some topics are more important to cover first?
• Any upcoming test?
• Also quite behind - I will start looking at the latest material
so that it is useful when I join any future meetings
• Tomorrow start Owl Creek - say to him you will start doing latest lesson
and on spare time I will catch up with the rest of the work.
